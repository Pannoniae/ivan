# Contribution Guidelines
All contributions on this project are welcomed and highly appreciated. You can see our guidelines below if you want to contribute to this project.

## Creating a peaceful development branch
You need to fork this project into your profile, so you can edit it. It should be deleted after the commitment of your code to the main branch of my repository so it won't cause any conflicts between the versions.

## Editing
You can use any editor if you want to, but you won't be able to run the code on your machine without our environment secret variables. We strongly recommend to use GitHub's built-in editor to write new code unless your new codebase is very huge. Don't worry on debugging! When you publish your code to a pull request, we'll debug it and modify any wrong code before launching to public.

## Opening a pull request
Once you've finished making changes, you can see at the top of your fork's start page how many changes you're ahead of my main repository (which is inside my profile). There you need to press the contribute button then open a pull request. After that, you must give some information about your modified code then press that open pull request button!

## Waiting for commit
We'll test and review your code as soon as possible and if applicable, I'll publish your code into production! After the commitment, you shall remove your fork from your profile so if you're going to contribute to this project again, you will begin with an empty paper.

## Thank you!
You have successfully contributed to this project! We're very gratefull for you! As our respect, I will add you to our contributors list inside the readme file! If you're inside the Communist Block Discord server, you'll get a medal too for "serving our country"!
