# Comrade Ivan Discord Bot

This bot makes [Hungarian Communist Block](https://www.google.com) more interactive with work, shop, trade and governance features. **Please note that this is not a real life politics/religion/finance thing and is just for communist soviet roleplay/fun.** Since the server's language is Hungarian, the bot "speaks" hungarian. We will try to add more languages soon.

## Meaning
Since everything has to be translated from Hungarian, it is necessary to shorten a few things. Here you can see some abbreviations that we use in this documentation.

SSD: State Security Department
HC: High Command
